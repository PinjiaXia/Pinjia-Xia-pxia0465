## Instructions on How to Interact with the Work

The inspiration for this art code work comes from the hope of making Monet's paintings sway gently like water plants in the water, following the waves. Through particle simulation and dynamic effects, static paintings are given life, presenting the feeling of water plants swaying in the water. Particles will interact based on the movement and clicking of the mouse.

### Interactive Mode

1. **Mouse movement**: When you move the mouse over the canvas, particles close to the mouse will enlarge, creating a ripple-like visual effect.
2. **Mouse click**: Clicking on the canvas will reset the positions of all particles, restart floating motion, and present a new dynamic image.
3. **Window adjustment**: Adjust the size of the browser window, and the canvas and particles will automatically adapt to the new size to maintain visual consistency.

Through the above methods, you can interact with the artwork and experience the dynamic changes and artistic expression of particles.

## Details of the Individual Approach to Animating the Group Code

1. I choose Perlin noise and randomness to drive my personal code.
2. My code decomposes Monet's paintings into particles and uses Perlin noise to simulate the floating effect of water waves, bringing a dynamic sense of flow to the paintings. At the same time, the code adds slight jitter and transparency changes to each particle, making colors and lighting appear softer. Mouse interaction enlarges particles and simulates the diffusion effect of water waves, making the artwork appear as if it is gently swaying in water.

### Inspiration Citation Explanation

![Description of GIF](re/lg.gif)

This GIF animation reminds me of plants or aquatic plants dancing gently with the water waves, echoing the soft brushstrokes and flowing texture in Monet's works. I hope to capture this dynamic vitality in my code works, turning Monet's paintings into particles, like aquatic plants in water, undulating with the waves.

Monet's works often pursue subtle changes in light, shadow, and color. My goal is to simulate these changes through programming, so that viewers can not only see static paintings, but also feel them flowing. Through mouse interaction, viewers can gently disturb the image like waves in water flow, experiencing the rebirth of art in digital media.

### Technical Specifications

My personal code achieved animation effects by decomposing the image into a large number of particles and simulating the floating of each particle using Perlin noise. These particles slowly shift in both horizontal and vertical directions, simulating the gentle flow of water waves, causing the image to sway like aquatic plants in water.

Compared to group code, I have made the following changes to my personal code:

1. **Particle system**: Decompose the image into particle objects, with each particle retaining its own color, position, and motion characteristics.
2. **Perlin Noise Animation**: Using Perlin noise to make particle motion more natural, breaking away from the static rectangular drawing.
3. **Mouse interaction**: Zoom in on particles as the mouse approaches, simulating the gentle disturbance of water flow.
